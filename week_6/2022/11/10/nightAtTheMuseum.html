  <p>These are some of the ceramics pieces that I saw at the night at the museum. I really liked these pieces because it’s a skill set that I don’t really have and find very impressive.</p>

<p>This piece depicts a devil fruit from One Piece. I personally thought this was really cool. I like the show one piece and I also really like this piece. I wanted to include it because I just thought it was really cool and very high quality as well.</p>

<p><img src="/CSPFastpages/images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is another piece I really liked. Though it isn’t finished the design is really cool and well made. I like dragons and stuff like that in general so this is a very cool depiction to me.</p>

<p><img src="/CSPFastpages/images/Aiden.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>These pieces were actually made by my twin, Aiden. It’s cool to see what he’s been working on throughout the year and I think it turned out really well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are also some cool CS projects that I saw
Some of the projects I saw were really cool like a timer to help with school work and a calender with the weather.</p>
