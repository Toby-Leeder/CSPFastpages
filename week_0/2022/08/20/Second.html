<p>I disabled comments. Why did I do it? I did it because I wanted to. You shouldn't be able to comment on this. If you can it means I did something wrong which would be bad, but I don't think I did. I think I did it right. Go try it right now actually I'll wait...</p>

<p>Thats a good word. It describes you. Did you just go check if you can comment on this page? I told you you couldn't. Did you still look? Did you scroll all the way to the bottom only to realize you couldn't actually comment and I was telling the truth? Did you realize that I didn't make a mistake and my new page works perfectly (and it works first time)? If you did shame on you. If you didn't I don't really care it's not like it really matters to me what you do. If I had ads on this website it would be one thing, but I don't. I don't even know if I can have ads. Can I? Who knows. Maybe I'll try it. I could make some money every time my assignments get graded. That could be a good idea. Though the money would probably be percents of a cent. It's still money. It's called passive income. Always the right choice.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>That's the end.</p>
