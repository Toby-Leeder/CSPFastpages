Lists can also have multiple dictionary entries in which each  dictionary has multiple key and   value pairs within it. Entries can be added into a list using the .append() method or just  use + and adding it. | \n",

That means you   can call each value using its unique key. This is useful for a lot of things. You              can also create a list of dictionaries, in which a list has multiple dictionary entries. Each dictionary can have multiple key and value pairs and is only   considered one entry in the list. |\n",

Essentially the try portion is what runs initially   and it will keep running the code within it until it runs and returns an error. Then   the except code runs after. You can change what the except code is depending   on the error or you can leave it generic so it runs for any error.|"
