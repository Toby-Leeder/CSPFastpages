description: This is my notes pages, I plan on putting a lot of the things I learn and some important syntax in here as well as in the notebook which demonstrates my learning. That means most of the information here can be found somewhere else, but it will all be organized and in one place on this page.

## Python Learns
> Also in the pythonQnA post

I've had very little experience with Python before I used it so here's some of the new functionality I learned and the syntax for it.

| Code | Syntax | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Variables | key = value | Unlike Java, it looks like Python doesn't really use <br> variable assignments like java. Instead variables <br> can just be assigned "any" and then can be <br> assigned numbers, letters, strings or pretty much <br> watever other value you want including lists. |
| Functions | def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterX): <br>   code <br>   return value | Functions are pretty similar to other languages <br> for the most part. It is a little different than java <br> in that you don't really use keywords before to define <br> it like int, string or void for the return type or <br> static, private and public. They still function (get it?) <br> pretty much the same though. |
| For loops | for newVar in definedVar: <br> code | For loops are probably the most different from Java. <br> This is because they go through a list of a variable <br> instead of creating a new integer and going until that <br> integer reaches a value. That interger is suprisingly <br> useful, so to me it seems like this change removes <br> some of the functionality of a for loop. Despite this <br> though I still found ways around it and was able <br> to accomplish my goals.
