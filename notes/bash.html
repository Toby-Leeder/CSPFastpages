<p>I’ve had basically no experience with Bash before this so it was interesting to learn some of the new functionality now as well. Here is some of what I learned.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Variables</td>
      <td>key=value</td>
      <td>Most variables work the same and it looks like bash works a similar way as well. You don’t put a space in between the key and the value. If you do it looks like bash reads the key as a command and so the variable doesn’t work. Also, to call a variable it looks like you need a $ sign in front, otherwise it just reads it as a string.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Echo</td>
      <td>echo “what you want to print”</td>
      <td>Echo is the bash version of print and pretty much works the same, though you can do some cool stuff with periods with it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>If then</td>
      <td>if [[ condition ]] then code else code fi</td>
      <td>This again is pretty similar to java or python though there are some differences. For example the condition needs [[]] which is different. Also, you need a then statement to run the code and at the end you need fi to finish the if statement.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
