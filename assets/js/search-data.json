I really liked these pieces because it’s a skill set that I don’t really have and find very impressive. . . This piece depicts a devil fruit from One Piece. I personally thought this was really cool. I like the show one piece and I also really like this piece. I wanted to include it because I just thought it was really cool and very high quality as well. . . This is another piece I really liked. Though it isn’t finished the design is really cool and well made. I like dragons and stuff like that in general so this is a very cool depiction to me. . . These pieces were actually made by my twin, Aiden. It’s cool to see what he’s been working on throughout the year and I think it turned out really well. . CS . There are also some cool CS projects that I saw Some of the projects I saw were really cool like a timer to help with school work and a calender with the weather. .",

            "content": "Purpose . This blog is where I tested and created much of the chessboard logic that I used later in our chess project. . Cell #1 . This section creates the chessBoard object and also creates a printboard function that I use later for testing. It also creates this lettersOnBoard string which I use for calculations for moves. I use the index in the list for all of the calculations. . chessBoard = {}; lettersOnBoard = &quot;abcdefgh&quot;; function printBoard(){ for (j = 0; j &lt;= 7; j++){ letter = lettersOnBoard[j]; console.log(&quot;&quot;) for (i = 1; i &lt;= 8; i++){ var newKey = letter + i; process.stdout.write(chessBoard[newKey][0] + &quot; &quot;); } } } . &#39;abcdefgh&#39; . Cell #2 . This cell defines the piece class. This class is intended to be a parent class for the other classes. Initially this class only had the constructor with position and color. Later however, I realized there were duplicate methods in the classes so I added them here. Those being the move method which actually changes the piece on the chessboard and getAvailableMoves which uses the captures and the freemoves and so is the same for all of the classes. . for (j = 0; j &lt;= 7; j++){ letter = lettersOnBoard[j]; for (i = 1; i &lt;= 8; i++){ var newKey = letter + i; chessBoard[newKey] = [&quot;OO&quot;, undefined] } } // piece class, to be extended by other classes class piece{ constructor(_position, _color){ this.position = _position; this.color = _color } move(move, currentM){ let currentBoard = chessBoard[currentM]; if(this.getAvailableMoves().includes(move)) { this.position = move; chessBoard[move] = currentBoard; chessBoard[currentM] = [&quot;OO&quot;, undefined]; } } getAvailableMoves(){ let freeMoves = this.getFreeMoves() let captures = this.getAvailableCaptures() captures.forEach((c) =&gt; { freeMoves.push(c); }) return freeMoves; } } .

Cell #4 . This is the bishop, the second to last piece I did. I though this piece was going to be really hard and I came up with complicated ways to figure out which moves are blocked and which moves are not. However it ended up working out really nicely. I was thinking about ways of coming up with the blocked moves without thinking of how to get all of the moves first. In the end to find all the moves I ended up going down and left until I reached an edge and then going from there and finding the rest of the moves by going back up and right. I did the same thing for the other way. This ended up with two seperate lists of moves. Then, since the lists were seperate, to check blocked moves I would only need to check one axis, not both. Because of this it was actually easy to find the blocked moves and it was similar to the rook. I actually made some advancements in this code and there&#39;s a lot of extra stuff I did for the rook that I didn&#39;t need to do. . class bishop extends piece{ constructor(_position, _color){ // super is the position constructor, uh basically does some super cool inheritence stuff or something. super(_position, _color); // automatically sets the spot on the board which is passed in to this rook this.id = &quot;B&quot; } //method to return all of the available moves that the piece can make. getTotalMoves(){ let currentPosition = this.position; let movesLToR = []; let movesRToL = []; let furthestLeft = currentPosition; let furthestRight = currentPosition; let bruh = 0; while (furthestLeft[0] != &quot;a&quot; &amp;&amp; furthestLeft[1] != 1){ furthestLeft = lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestLeft[0]) - 1] + (furthestLeft[1] - 1); } while (furthestRight[0] != &quot;h&quot; &amp;&amp; furthestRight[1] != 1){ furthestRight = lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestRight[0]) + 1] + (furthestRight[1] - 1); } for (i = 0; i &lt; 8 - lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestLeft[0]) - furthestLeft[1] + 1; i++){ movesLToR.push(lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestLeft[0]) + i] + (parseInt(furthestLeft[1]) + i)); } for (i = 0; i &lt; 2 + lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestRight[0]) - furthestRight[1]; i++){ movesRToL.push(lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(furthestRight[0]) - i] + (parseInt(furthestRight[1]) + i)); } let totalMovesLToR = []; let totalMovesRToL = [] movesLToR.forEach((c) =&gt; { if (c != this.position){ totalMovesLToR.push(c); } }); movesRToL.forEach((c) =&gt; { if (c != this.position){ totalMovesRToL.push(c); } }); return [totalMovesLToR, totalMovesRToL]; } //method to return all of the obstructed moves based on the total moves getObstructedMoves(){ let totalMoves = this.getTotalMoves(); let obstructedMovesLToR = []; let obstructedMovesRToL = []; let blockedMovesLToR = []; let blockedMovesRToL = []; let index = -1 // Finds the moves which are behind an obstructed move and also finds all of the obstructed moves.

This piece was easier than the rook and the bishop. The only complicated part was setting up double move for the first move, but it wasn&#39;t that bad. I set up a variable which displayed whether or not it had moved yet and then changed the available moves based on that. Also, this class has it&#39;s own unique move method which uses the parent class move and adds a single line where is changes the hasMoved variable to 1 to show that it can&#39;t move two anymore. The other thing that I had to do different was directionality, but I was able to just used the color to create a direction variable. The captures were also a little different because they weren&#39;t in the possible moves, but that actually made it easier. . class pawn extends piece{ constructor(_position, _color){ // super is the position constructor, uh basically does some super cool inheritence stuff or something. super(_position, _color); // automatically sets the spot on the board which is passed in to this pawn using the parent method if (_color == &quot;w&quot;){this.direction = 1} else if (_color == &quot;b&quot;) {this.direction = -1} this.hasMoved = 0; this.id = &quot;P&quot;; } move(move, currentM){ super.move(move, currentM) this.hasMoved = 1 } getTotalMoves(){ let moves = []; let currentPosition = this.position.split(&quot;&quot;); if(this.hasMoved == 0){ moves.push(currentPosition[0] + (parseInt(currentPosition[1]) + (1 * this.direction))) moves.push(currentPosition[0] + (parseInt(currentPosition[1]) + (2 * this.direction))) } else{ moves.push(currentPosition[0] + (parseInt(currentPosition[1]) + (1 * this.direction))) } return moves; } getFreeMoves(){ let moves = this.getTotalMoves(); let freeMoves = []; if (chessBoard[moves[0]][0] == &quot;OO&quot;){ freeMoves.push(moves[0]); try{ if (chessBoard[moves[1]][0] == &quot;OO&quot;){freeMoves.push(moves[1]);} }catch{} } return freeMoves; } getAvailableCaptures(){ let captures = []; let currentPosition = this.position.split(&quot;&quot;); let possibleLets = [ lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(currentPosition[0]) - 1], lettersOnBoard[lettersOnBoard.indexOf(currentPosition[0]) + 1] ]; possibleLets = possibleLets.filter(c =&gt; c != undefined); possibleLets.forEach((c) =&gt; { let a = parseInt(currentPosition[1]) + (1 * this.direction) let check = c + a if (chessBoard[check][0][0] != this.color &amp;&amp; chessBoard[check][0] != &quot;OO&quot;){ captures.push(check); } }) return captures; } } let pawn1 = new pawn(&quot;c5&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) chessBoard[pawn1.position] = [pawn1.color + pawn1.id, pawn1] printBoard() .

            "content": "Program Purpose . Big Idea 1 . Program Purpose and Function Our Program’s purpose is to play a succesful game of chess and declare a victor (or stalemate) and to allow the player to customize the game to a certain degree. The functions will be moving pieces, capturing pieces, recording captured pieces, customizing where the pieces are. . Big Idea 2 . Data Abstraction One small example of a list would be the pieces that have been captured, they would be kept in a list in order to display as well as calculate the points a player has. Also, the moves a pieces can legally make would be in a list as well, actually in a dictionary which corresponds the moves and pieces. Also, there would be lists of pieces for definitions and the board would be defined as a list of corresponding letters and numbers as well. . Big Idea 3 . Managing Complexity The list of possible moves helps to abstract the moves for each piece. In this way each piece instance can function the same way and only be specified by its defined characteristics. The board being defined as letter and number pairs also helps, as we will be able to add the number of squares a piece to the current place on the board in order to check. . Big Idea 4 . Procedural Abstraction We will have many procedures. One might be calculating the possible moves based on the piece type and the current position. This will be abstracted further through a function to calculate the change in letter and number of the posititon and return the change in x and y. . Big Idea 5 . Algorithm Implementation One algorithm we will use which will sequence, select and iterate is the algorithm to determine the possible moves. This will generate a list of options and return those options. . Big Idea 6 . Testing We will be blogging the issues we encounter (probably in a google drive so we can all work together) .",

List | key = [value, value, …] | Lists in python are sorta like arrays in Java. They are different because a list can have multiple different data types within it. Lists can also have multiple dictionary entries in which each dictionary has multiple key and value pairs within it. Entries can be added into a list using the .append() method or just use + and adding it. | . Dictionary | dictionary_key = {key: value, key: value …} | Dictionaries are similar to lists, but instead of just holding values with one single key, each individual value is paired with its own key. That means you can call each value using its unique key. This is useful for a lot of things. You can also create a list of dictionaries, in which a list has multiple dictionary entries. Each dictionary can have multiple key and value pairs and is only considered one entry in the list. | . Try, except | try: code except error: code except: code | This is an interesting code that I already knew about from previous experience, but I found it could be useful here. Essentially the try portion is what runs initially and it will keep running the code within it until it runs and returns an error. Then the except code runs after. You can change what the except code is depending on the error or you can leave it generic so it runs for any error. | .",

I’ve had very little experience with Python before I used it so here’s some of the new functionality I learned and the syntax for it. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key = value | Unlike Java, it looks like Python doesn’t really use variable assignments like java. Instead variables can just be assigned “any” and then can be assigned numbers, letters, strings or pretty much watever other value you want including lists. | . Functions | def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterX): code return value | Functions are pretty similar to other languages for the most part. It is a little different than java in that you don’t really use keywords before to define it like int, string or void for the return type or static, private and public. They still function (get it?) pretty much the same though. | . For loops | for newVar in definedVar: code | For loops are probably the most different from Java. This is because they go through a list of a variable instead of creating a new integer and going until that integer reaches a value. That interger is suprisingly useful, so to me it seems like this change removes some of the functionality of a for loop. Despite this though I still found ways around it and was able to accomplish my goals. | .",

I’ve had basically no experience with Bash before this so it was interesting to learn some of the new functionality now as well. Here is some of what I learned. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key=value | Most variables work the same and it looks like bash works a similar way as well. You don’t put a space in between the key and the value. If you do it looks like bash reads the key as a command and so the variable doesn’t work. Also, to call a variable it looks like you need a $ sign in front, otherwise it just reads it as a string. | . Echo | echo “what you want to print” | Echo is the bash version of print and pretty much works the same, though you can do some cool stuff with periods with it. | . If then | if [[ condition ]] then code else code fi | This again is pretty similar to java or python though there are some differences. For example the condition needs [[]] which is different.

The last question I wasn’t sure on because it was correct on a technicality but I did get it right. While users could help identify errors they made, the couldn’t fix it. . Program Function and Purpose Quiz . Score: 6/6 This was the hardest quiz for sure. The fifth question had some code that was pretty difficult to understand but once I realized how ti worked it was pretty cool. Also in general the code language is a little weird. The way they set variables and print stuff. It seems like they changed a lot of stuff just for the sake of changing it and in turn made it worse. Overall though it was still easy. . Program Design and Development Quiz . Score: 3/3 This quiz was pretty easy overall. The only thing that I was confused on is that indexes for collegeboard start at 1. This means that arrays start at 1 and not zero so one question about switching the valuesin an array was a little weird. . Week 7 . Copy of Identifying and Correcting Errors Quiz . Score: 2/3 This quiz was the hardest one I’d had up to this point. It was the first one I got something wrong, but that was because I didn’t read that there were 2 answers. It doesn’t really make sense to me though. These situations are really unrealistic I feel, you don’t really end up with code like that which is just completely non-functional at a fundamental level. . Final . During the test . Question 16, I don’t think I did the Internet assignment so I didn’t know. I had to use other resources like the internet video to find the correct answer. | Question 17, I also didn’t know this one and had a friend help me figure it out. | Question 18, another I didn’t know. | Question 19 - 21, these questions were about binary and I didn’t know a lot about binary. I knew the basics, but Gene knew more about binary so he was able to help us. | Question 22, how does binary. I didn’t realize that you go right to left for binary numbers so that confused me, but I was able to look back at a previous question to figure it out. Score: 47/50 | Question 43, for this question I made the code myself in javascript, but I did it wrong. I thought it would run 5 times but it actually would have run 6 times so I needed to iterate through one more time. | Question 49, I guessed for this one because I was running out of time. If I had time I would have gotten it correct, it was a pretty simple problem. | Question 50, same as 49 I guessed for this one. It’s also a really simple question though that I would have gotten right. | .",

Toby Leeder | Kevin He | Adrita Chakraborty | Hema | All of the above (C) | . | Stuff went wrong . this is where I takl about everything that is not really working . The first thing that I just figured out was how to call a table. Ideally my code is abstract, so I want it all to be in functions which run repeatedly with a table. The first part of that though is accessing the data in a table. The only way to do this that I found is use a getColumn function which returns a list of all the entries in the column which you can then access using basic list syntax. I didn’t know that you could use basic list syntax though and it took me a bit to figure that out. | Another thing that went wrong was I made a mistake and started off with the initial question number being 1. This meant that it started with entry number 1 in the table. At the beginning I just added in two table entrys so I didn’t notics this the entire time. This became an issue when I was trying to test mutiplt questions. The second question kept not loading and just saying undefined and it took me a bit to realize that this is because it was looking for a third entry that didn’t exist and not the second entry. I got confused, but eventually figured it out. | . Here it is . Here is a link to my final app lab project .",

They are different because a list can have multiple different data types within it. Lists can also have multiple dictionary entries in which each dictionary has multiple key and value pairs within it. Entries can be added into a list using the .append() method or just use + and adding it. | . Dictionary | dictionary_key = {key: value, key: value ...} | Dictionaries are similar to lists, but instead of just holding values with one single key, each individual value is paired with its own key. That means you can call each value using its unique key. This is useful for a lot of things. You can also create a list of dictionaries, in which a list has multiple dictionary entries. Each dictionary can have multiple key and value pairs and is only considered one entry in the list. | . Try, except | try: code except error: code except: code | This is an interesting code that I already knew about from previous experience, but I found it could be useful here. Essentially the try portion is what runs initially and it will keep running the code within it until it runs and returns an error. Then the except code runs after. You can change what the except code is depending on the error or you can leave it generic so it runs for any error. | .",

Bash Learns . I&#39;ve had basically no experience with Bash before this so it was interesting to learn some of the new functionality now as well. Here is some of what I learned. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key=value | Most variables work the same and it looks like bash works a similar way as well. You don&#39;t put a space in between the key and the value. If you do it looks like bash reads the key as a command and so the variable doesn&#39;t work. Also, to call a variable it looks like you need a $ sign in front, otherwise it just reads it as a string. | . Echo | echo &quot;what you want to print&quot; | Echo is the bash version of print and pretty much works the same, though you can do some cool stuff with periods with it. | . If then | if [[ condition ]] then code else code fi | This again is pretty similar to java or python though there are some differences. For example the condition needs [[]] which is different. Also, you need a then statement to run the code and at the end you need fi to finish the if statement. | .",

I&#39;ve had very little experience with Python before I used it so here&#39;s some of the new functionality I learned and the syntax for it. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key = value | Unlike Java, it looks like Python doesn&#39;t really use variable assignments like java. Instead variables can just be assigned &quot;any&quot; and then can be assigned numbers, letters, strings or pretty much watever other value you want including lists. | . Functions | def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterX): code return value | Functions are pretty similar to other languages for the most part. It is a little different than java in that you don&#39;t really use keywords before to define it like int, string or void for the return type or static, private and public. They still function (get it?) pretty much the same though. | . For loops | for newVar in definedVar: code | For loops are probably the most different from Java. This is because they go through a list of a variable instead of creating a new integer and going until that integer reaches a value. That interger is suprisingly useful, so to me it seems like this change removes some of the functionality of a for loop. Despite this though I still found ways around it and was able to accomplish my goals. | .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

          "content": "| Home | Python | Bash | More Python | Link 4 (TBD) . | . This is my notes pages, I plan on putting a lot of the things I learn and some important syntax in here as well as in the notebook which demonstrates my learning. That means most of the information here can be found somewhere else, but it will all be organized and in one place on this page. . Python Learns . Also in the QnA w/Python post. . I’ve had very little experience with Python before I used it so here’s some of the new functionality I learned and the syntax for it. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key = value | Unlike Java, it looks like Python doesn’t really use variable assignments like java. Instead variables can just be assigned “any” and then can be assigned numbers, letters, strings or pretty much watever other value you want including lists. | . Functions | def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterX): code return value | Functions are pretty similar to other languages for the most part. It is a little different than java in that you don’t really use keywords before to define it like int, string or void for the return type or static, private and public. They still function (get it?) pretty much the same though. | . For loops | for newVar in definedVar: code | For loops are probably the most different from Java. This is because they go through a list of a variable instead of creating a new integer and going until that integer reaches a value. That interger is suprisingly useful, so to me it seems like this change removes some of the functionality of a for loop. Despite this though I still found ways around it and was able to accomplish my goals. | . Bash Learns . Also in the Checks w/Bash post. . I’ve had basically no experience with Bash before this so it was interesting to learn some of the new functionality now as well. Here is some of what I learned. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | key=value | Most variables work the same and it looks like bash works a similar way as well. You don’t put a space in between the key and the value. If you do it looks like bash reads the key as a command and so the variable doesn’t work. Also, to call a variable it looks like you need a $ sign in front, otherwise it just reads it as a string. | . Echo | echo “what you want to print” | Echo is the bash version of print and pretty much works the same, though you can do some cool stuff with periods with it. | . If then | if [[ condition ]] then code else code fi | This again is pretty similar to java or python though there are some differences. For example the condition needs [[]] which is different. Also, you need a then statement to run the code and at the end you need fi to finish the if statement. | . More Python Learns . Also in the Lists and Dictionaries w/Python . Code Syntax Notes . List | key = [value, value, …] | Lists in python are sorta like arrays in Java. They are different because a list can have multiple different data types within it. Lists can also have multiple dictionary entries in which each dictionary has multiple key and value pairs within it. Entries can be added into a list using the .append() method or just use + and adding it. | . Dictionary | dictionary_key = {key: value, key: value …} | Dictionaries are similar to lists, but instead of just holding values with one single key, each individual value is paired with its own key. That means you can call each value using its unique key. This is useful for a lot of things. You can also create a list of dictionaries, in which a list has multiple dictionary entries. Each dictionary can have multiple key and value pairs and is only considered one entry in the list. | . Try, except | try: code except error: code except: code | This is an interesting code that I already knew about from previous experience, but I found it could be useful here. Essentially the try portion is what runs initially and it will keep running the code within it until it runs and returns an error. Then the except code runs after. You can change what the except code is depending on the error or you can leave it generic so it runs for any error. | .",

Some functions are built in like printing functions and some are created by the programmer. Syntax differs by language, but most have | . | Jekyll language used for some parts of fastpages | . | Liquid Language used to build the tags page | . | Procedural Abstraction this is confusing for me. Essentially its a procedure of abstracting out functions to higher levels. For example, if we have a multiplication function and we run that function we don’t care how it multiplies the numbers we input, we just want it to multiply the numbers. This is procedurally abstracting the process to the lowest level of computations. | . | Local Server Running one right now! It’s a server running locally on my computer using Docker Packages.
