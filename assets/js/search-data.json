I&#39;ve had very little experience with Python before I used it so here&#39;s some of the new functionality I learned and the syntax for it. . Code Syntax Notes . Variables | Key = Value | Unlike Java, it looks like Python doesn&#39;t really use variable assignments like java. Instead variables can just be assigned &quot;any&quot; and then can be assigned numbers, letters, strings or pretty much watever other value you want including lists. | . Functions | def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterX): code return value | Functions are pretty similar to other languages for the most part. It is a little different than java in that you don&#39;t really use keywords before to define it like int, string or void for the return type or static, private and public. They still function (get it?) pretty much the same though. | . For loops | for newVar in definedVar: code | For loops are probably the most different from Java. This is because they go through a list of a variable instead of creating a new integer and going until that integer reaches a value. That interger is suprisingly useful, so to me it seems like this change removes some of the functionality of a for loop. Despite this though I still found ways around it and was able to accomplish my goals. | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
