## Alumni Panel Thoughts

I'm really glad I was able to attend this event. It was really interesting and I learned a lot of new things. I didn't realize just how much programming is used in the STEM world and it was really interesting for me to learn that. Also, I learned that the best time to apply for internships is in September and December. Overall I'm really glad I went and I feel good about my choice in taking APCSP. 

## Alumni Panel Notes

| Question | Colein | Anthony | Andrew | Maybel | Allison | Nitiya |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| How did you realize what you wanted to do and how did csp help? | “Hmm I can code well but I can 3d model better” <br> Compsci is a lot about perspective, look at people who are not classmates and see how you compare | Loves problem solving and cs <br> Liked curriculum | Realized he liked complexity, and theory about cs, liked java backends development and all that stuff <br> Thought he was pretty decent at that | Didn’t like class, knew it was important to learn <br> Did cs even though not a cs major <br> It’s useful in life and you’ll need to know it at some point <br> Didn’t like aerospace so switched to cog sci | Didn’t really like cs but still doing it <br> Liked some design aspects of it and is doing cog sci | Always interested in computer science from young age <br> Middle school and high school taking more seriously <br> How could she apply her skills <br> Realized what she’s creating could be used in the real world | 
| Biggest challenge you've encountered in comp sci | Starting sucks <br> Error messages are annoying and you don’t know how to fix it <br> There is something on the internet to help you | Clashing Egos, working together is hard and cs majors aren’t nice are very showy, can be frustrating <br> Can feel bad about yourself <br> You have to focus on yourself and your own path <br> Don’t worry about other people | Theory is difficult, idea behind it <br> Weird, complicated is confusing, hard transition from high school to college | Motivation to do CS, always someone better than you <br> Internship makes you do CS, still need to do CS <br> A specific project or purpose is helpful <br> Frustrated with syntax <br> Don’t expect you to know all the syntax, just google it or ask for help | Starting, temptation to bs stuff <br> Making sure you don’t cut corners, actually do the work to learn <br> Mindset to go above and beyond solves problems in the long run | Not always gonna have a rigid structure and how to do things <br> Willing to kinda just start even if you don’t have a plan |
| Are there any PBL (project-based learning) scenarios in College? | -   Not that many, working on a project isn’t super common but it does still happen so you need to know how to do it | | CS courses do have projects but there are also a lot of tests <br> There is still PBL | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer everyone's attention and answer every question <br> Study groups help <br> There are some project classes where they do work on a lot of projects but thats where managing groups is difficult <br> Figure out what works best for you <br> Especially internships they don’t really expect you to know what to do | | |
|Have you applied cs in your major if you are not majoring in CS?| A lot of menial tasks that you can speed up by writing a script to help speed up things <br> Coding is everywhere you need so you can know what you’re doing <br> Advanced calculations are easier with coding as well | | High level math computer science can help <br> Math libraries can be helpful to use | Program stuff in CAD like analysis and cad <br> You can code 3d printing stuff without a 3d model <br> Making things faster so you don’t have to do it all manually <br> Internships sometimes just make you do software <br> Problem solving logic used everywhere | Cog sci does use computer science <br> More front end <br> Requirements are stats and psych courses, can use comp sci in stats <br> Psych has cs as well, mat lab and other stuff | | 
|For existing college students have you had a job at your school| Make a resume <br> You put resumes into job sights <br> Push yourself to be above and beyond <br> Make your professors like you | Code ninjas, it's a franchise | Tutor at the school <br> LG internship, woked with APIs and web development, used javascript html and python | Interact with professors and ask them if there is any space in their lab <br> Interact with the TAs and stuff | | |
|Any personal projects?| | | Companies look for that especially without work experience <br> If you can find the time it looks good <br> 2-3 personal projects are really useful, they can look at what you’re doing | | | |
|Computer science in mechanical engineering | Mirrored components say mirrored at the end each time <br> Made a script that isolated the mirrored and took out the text and removed it <br> Sometimes you have to actually go into the code for Computer Aided Machinery <br> Simulations for materials, sometimes done by hand|






Tips to get a job: 
- Have a resume
- Know when to apply
- A lot of companies start hiring in September and November the year before
- Have proof of work that you’ve done
- It doesn’t really matter what school you go to
- Personal projects, project teams and clubs are important
- Smaller local companies generally take high school interns
