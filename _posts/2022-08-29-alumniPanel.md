## Alumni Panel Thoughts

I'm really glad I was able to attend this event. It was really interesting and I learned a lot of new things. I didn't realize just how much programming is used in the STEM world and it was really interesting for me to learn that. Also, I learned that the best time to apply for internships is in September and December. Overall I'm really glad I went and I feel good about my choice in taking APCSP.
