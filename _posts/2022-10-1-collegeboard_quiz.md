## Collaboration Quiz
> Score: 3/3
This quiz was interesting, but easy. The last question I wasn't sure on because it was correct on a technicality but I did get it right. While users could help identify errors they made, the couldn't fix it.

## Program Function and Purpose Quiz
> Score: 6/6
This was the hardest quiz for sure. The fifth question had some code that was pretty difficult to understand but once I realized how ti worked it was pretty cool. Also in general the code language is a little weird. The way they set variables and print stuff. It seems like they changed a lot of stuff just for the sake of changing it and in turn made it worse. Overall though it was still easy. 

## Program Design and Development Quiz
> Score: 3/3
This quiz was pretty easy overall. The only thing that I was confused on is that indexes for collegeboard start at 1. This means that arrays start at 1 and not zero so one question about switching the valuesin an array was a little weird.
