# 5.1 and 5.2 notes

Our project has a few benefits being a site to play video games. The major benefit is to alleviate boredom. It will do this by providing entertainment through the many different games available. Also, this website provides a premier avenue for friendly competition with your friends, through our online gameplay capabilities. It also can facilitate learning from your mistakes via the history page. 

Our website could have a harmful effect if people become addicted to our games. 


Internet blockers I think simply limit people. As highschoolers we should be able to think and make descisions for ourself. We're mature, so we shouldn't be limited from doing things. As highschoolers our education is already our own responsability. We don't need others to keep us accountable. 

I'm concerned about the digital divide because it won't really get any better. It will only continue to increase and get worse and worse, those who don't have access to technology may never be able to have adequate access in order to participate in a further technological society.
